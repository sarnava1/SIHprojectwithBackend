This contains the entire software with complete backend of the project for Smart India Hardware Hackathon 2k18. There will be major frontend and backend modifications though in the coming versions. This project was started to make the High Voltage Lab of NIT Durgapur the first IoT enabled High Voltage Laboratory in the world and fulfil the dreams of our visionary professor Nirmal Kumar Roy sir. All our experiments can be performed from anywhere in the world. The temporary testing site is hosted at https://limitless-gorge-64134.herokuapp.com/logtoexp1 and the production site is hosted at hvl.nitdgp.ac.in
